				Hallie Frost grew up in Portland, Oregon, a rain drenched city that rests on occupied Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Chinook, Tualatin, Kalapuya, and Molalla lands. From 2015-2017 she worked as the Art Editor of the Oregon Voice magazine while studying Fine Art and Philosophy at the University of Oregon.  Since moving to Berlin she has worked as a freelance writer and editor most recently for <a href=" http://artsoftheworkingclass.org/"> Arts of the Working Class </a> where she is currently the Online Editor and Managing Editor for the bi-monthly newspaper. As an editor she strives to make 'good ideas' more legible than the bad, as an artist her mediums range from painting to hair sculpture and as a human she dreams of an old age on earth.
