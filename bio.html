    From 2015-2017 she worked as the Art Editor of <a href="https://issuu.com/ovmag" class="gradient-link" target="_blank">Oregon Voice</a> and completed her Bachelors in Humanities and Fine Art. <br><br>

    From 2018-2020 she worked as a freelance writer and editor for <a href="https://artsoftheworkingclass.org/" class="gradient-link" target="_blank">Arts of the Working Class</a>.<br><br>

    From 2020-2023 she worked at <a href="https://spreuthmagers.com" class="gradient-link" target="_blank">Sprüth Magers</a>, as the editor for <a href="https://weirdeconomies.com/" class="gradient-link" target="_blank">Weird Economies</a> and collaborated on curatorial projects with <a href="https://raeume.art/" class="gradient-link" target="_blank">Räume</a>. <br>
    She also started a clothing brand of streetwear sourced from walking around the city and collecting discarded items. <br>
    She would alter then sell them under hype-based pricing through Instagram. <br>
    The Brand was called Burnt—sustainable and unattainable due to the exclusive number of items and limited interest of the manufacturer to go to the post office and ship them.<br><br>

    In 2024 she completed her certification in Digital Product Design and launched <a href="https://www.hxlocreative.com/" class="gradient-link" target="_blank">Halo Creative</a> basically to fund an unavailing job search to move out of the Art World. <br>
    In 2025 she launched a new podcast, <a href="https://burningdesirepodcast.com/" class="gradient-link" target="_blank">Burning Desire</a>, and will be speaking at Art Dubai in April. <br><br>
