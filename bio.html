				Halle Frost grew up in Portland, Oregon-- a rain drenched city that rests on occupied lands and the Cascadia subduction zone. 
				She spent the majority of her 20s in city built on a bog, home to "Vier der bestedn Unis in Deutschland. Fünf, wenn man die strasse mitzält"
				
				From 2015-2017 she worked as the Art Editor of the Oregon Voice and completed her Bachelors in Humanities and Fine Art. 
				
				From 2018-2020 she worked as a freelance writer and editor for Arts of the Working Class.
				
				From 2020-2023 she worked at Sprueth Magers gallery, as the editor for Weird Economies and collaborated on curatorial projects with Räume. 
				She also started a clothing brand of street wear sourced from walking around the city and collecting discarded items. 
				She would alter then sell them under hype-based pricing through Instagram. 
				The Brand was called Burnt. Sustainable and unattainable due to the exclusive number of items and limited interest of the manufacturer to go to the post office and ship them.
				
				In 2024 she completed her certification in Digital Product Design and launched Halo Creative basically to fund an unavailing job search to move out of the Art World. 
				In 2025 she launched a new podcast, Burning Desire and will be speaking at Art Dubai in April. 
				
				As an editor she strives to make 'good ideas' more legible than the bad. 
				As an artist her mediums range from painting to podcasting.
				As a human she dreams of an old age on earth.
